## Features

Tutan Common is a collection of under-the-hood functions and behavioral extensions for WordPress developers. There is a lot here! Refer to the [reference section](#reference) below for detailed documentation on each and every function.



## Installation

Because Tutan Common is a developer resource rather than something end users can directly play with, it is not part of the main WordPress plugin repository. Therefore it must be manually installed.

The current release requires PHP 7+ and several additional modules. Refer to the [requirements](https://github.com/Blobfolio/blob-common#requirements) for `blob-common`. If you meet these standards, download the [current release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobfolio/blob-common/master/release/blob-common.zip).

Otherwise if you are running PHP 5.4+, you can download the [legacy release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/blob-common/raw/1.5/release/blob-common.zip). Please note this version is unlikely to receive new features, so it is not recommended for new sites.

Plugin updates will be delivered the usual way through WordPress Admin; no special effort required.

Existing legacy installs will upgrade to the current release if the server is determined to meet the requirements; otherwise it will continue checking for new legacy releases.



## Reference

All functions are prefixed with `common_` or `_common_` to help separate namespace. You can override or replace any function by declaring it before Tutan Common is loaded, either inside `wp-config.php` or a plugin with a higher priority.

Some functionality is toggled by constants defined in `wp-config`. They are explained in more detail in the corresponding function documentation, but quickly, they are:

 * (*bool*) **WP_DB_DEBUG_LOG** - Log database query errors to `wp-content/db-debug.log`
 * (*string*) **WP_DEBUG_EMAIL** - Send debug emails to an address other than the site email
 * (*string*) **WP_DEBUG_LOG_CAP** - Capability required to view `Tools > Debug Log`; Default: `"manage_options"`
 * (*bool*) **WP_DISABLE_EMOJI** - Disable WP's emoji scripts and styles
 * (*bool*) **WP_DISABLE_JQUERY_MIGRATE** - Disable WP's jQuery Migrate script
 * (*bool*) **WP_JIT_IMAGES** - Enable just-in-time thumbnail generation
 * (*string*) **WP_WEBP_CWEBP** - Override default bin path for `cwebp`
 * (*string*) **WP_WEBP_GIF2WEBP** - Override default bin path for `gif2webp`
 * (*bool*) **WP_WEBP_IMAGES** - Enable WebP features
