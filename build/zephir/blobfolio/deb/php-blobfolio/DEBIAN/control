Description: Blobfolio Common PHP
 Blob-common is a set of tools to help make sanitizing, formatting,
 and other data manipulation tasks easier and better than they are
 with native PHP functionality alone.
 .
 This extension implements some of the more baser functions contained
 in the PHP library, allowing them to execute 10-1000x more
 efficiently.
 .
 This is highly experimental, subject to change, and *NOT* recommended
 for production use.
