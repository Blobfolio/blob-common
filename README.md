# blob-common

## Requirements

blob-common requires PHP 5.6+ with the following modules:

 * BCMath or GMP
 * DOM
 * Fileinfo
 * Filter
 * JSON
 * MBString
 * SimpleXML

UTF-8 is used for all string encoding. This could create conflicts on environments using something else.

The [WebP](https://github.com/Blobfolio/blob-common/wiki/Images) functionality additionally requires access to server-side `cwebp` and `gif2webp` binaries. See the linked reference for more details.

&nbsp;

## Installation

Use Composer:

```bash
composer require "blobfolio/blob-common:dev-master"
```

Or grab the compiled Phar and include it in your project:

```php
require_once('bin/blob-common.phar');
```

Note: The Phar is gzipped so PHP needs to have gzip capabilities to be able to read it. :)
