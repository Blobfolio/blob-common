## Requirements

blob-common requires PHP 7+ with the following modules:

 * BCMath
 * DOM
 * Fileinfo
 * Filter
 * JSON
 * MBString
 * SimpleXML

UTF-8 is used for all string encoding. This could create conflicts on environments using something else.

The [WebP](https://github.com/Blobfolio/blob-common/blob/master/docs/IMAGE.md) functionality additionally requires access to server-side `cwebp` and `gif2webp` binaries. See the linked reference for more details.



## Installation

Use Composer:

```bash
composer require "blobfolio/blob-common:dev-master"
```
