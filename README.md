## Features

Tutan Common is a collection of under-the-hood functions and behavioral extensions for WordPress developers. There is a lot here! Refer to the [reference section](#reference) below for detailed documentation on each and every function.



## Installation

Because Tutan Common is a developer resource rather than something end users can directly play with, it is not part of the main WordPress plugin repository. Therefore it must be manually installed:

 * [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobfolio/blob-common/master/release/blob-common.zip) the latest stable release and extract the archive contents to your `plugins` folder;
 * Or use the `Upload Plugin` option from within WordPress to do the dirty work for you;

Plugin updates, however, don't require any special effort. Tutan Common hooks into WordPress' plugin API and will notify you of new releases, allow you to apply them from the Updates page, etc., just like any other plugin.



## Reference

All functions are prefixed with `common_` or `_common_` to help separate namespace. You can override or replace any function by declaring it before Tutan Common is loaded, either inside `wp-config.php` or a plugin with a higher priority.

Some functionality is toggled by constants defined in `wp-config`. They are explained in more detail in the corresponding function documentation, but quickly, they are:

 * (*bool*) **WP_DB_DEBUG_LOG** - Log database query errors to `wp-content/db-debug.log`
 * (*string*) **WP_DEBUG_EMAIL** - Send debug emails to an address other than the site email
 * (*bool*) **WP_DISABLE_EMOJI** - Disable WP's emoji scripts and styles
 * (*bool*) **WP_DISABLE_JQUERY_MIGRATE** - Disable WP's jQuery Migrate script
 * (*bool*) **WP_JIT_IMAGES** - Enable just-in-time thumbnail generation
 * (*string*) **WP_WEBP_CWEBP** - Override default bin path for `cwebp`
 * (*string*) **WP_WEBP_GIF2WEBP** - Override default bin path for `gif2webp`
 * (*bool*) **WP_WEBP_IMAGES** - Enable WebP features

To make digestion easier, the function documentation is broken up into the following broad categories:
